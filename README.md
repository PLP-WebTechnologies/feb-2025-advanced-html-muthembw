# Shelby Limited Staff Page

This is a simple HTML-based webpage for Shelby Limited to display staff information, office locations, and an employee registration form.

## 📌 Features

- Welcome message and company description
- Ordered list of company managers
- Table listing manager contact details
- Image slider showcasing different office locations
- Employee registration form with basic validations
- Thank you message displayed after form submission

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **Image Slider**
- Uses the deprecated `<marquee>` tag to scroll office images from left to right.
- Speed can be adjusted using the `scrollamount` attribute.

### 2. **Employee Registration Form**
- Collects name, email, password, gender, location, department, and feedback.
- Email input is validated using HTML5 `type="email"`.
- Password input requires at least 6 characters using the `minlength` attribute.

### 3. **Thank You Message**
- Shown to anyone who visits this web page.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone or download the HTML file and assets.
2. Open the `.html` file in any modern browser.
3. Fill in the form to see the animated thank you message.

## ⚠️ Notes

- `<marquee>` is deprecated and not recommended for production. Consider replacing it with a CSS/JS carousel for modern usage.
- Ensure form inputs have proper `name` attributes if the data is to be submitted to a server.

## ✅ To Do (Improvements)
- Replace `<marquee>` with a modern slider.
- Add server-side handling for submitted form data.
- Include form field validation messages for better user experience.
